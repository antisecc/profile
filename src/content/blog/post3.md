Open beta season is a seasonal competition conducted by HackTheBox, the season consists of weekly machines released over 
the period of 3 months with varying difficulty and mainly based on Windows or Linux and with new technlogies, techniques 
implemented for people to practice red teaming

Having been played the last 3 season of this competition I feel like there is so much to explore and learn about latest 
trends, techniques and technology of today's world about computers, I am still a novice at pentesting but doing these 
machines kind of gave me a little confidence, but it still feels I am really lacking behin, nevertheless it was great 
experience

Having said that I am still kind of have this unsettling feeling like some machines had a really unique way to gain access 
to the system, for e.g. one machine had a flaw of getting a RCE through file upload and upon trying numerous shells and 
carfting some myself it didn't work and felt like a rabbit hole but it was all along the same vuln which can get you the 
access but the only thing was that there was this one guy who uploaded a rev shell and that only seemed to work, I don't 
how to feel about that...

So far over the past seasons the machines which are really something to explore and fun are Ouija, Corporate and Rebound 
machine for me :D


Maybe I will write some writeups or something like short a guide for those machines but after machines retire
