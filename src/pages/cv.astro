    I have started my learning journey in late of year 2021, with a steep learning curve as a complete IT novice fresh out of high school.
    <br> <br>
    Research and acquisition: Armed with determination, I dived into research, devouring resources, materials, and concepts. I explored various platforms to hone my skills, laying the foundation for my technological understanding.
    <br> <br>
    Mid-2022: By mid-2022, computers no longer held mysteries. I had built a solid foundation in networking fundamentals and secured an adequate grasp of basic security principles.
    <br> <br>
    Security domain exploration (late 2022): Late 2022 marked the exciting foray into the realm of security. I delved into the diverse subdomains, eager to unlock their secrets.
    <br> <br>
    Early 2023: By early 2023, my knowledge of Security Operations, Red Teaming, and Penetration Testing had evolved into a formidable arsenal.
    <br> <br>
    From then on I put on knowledge to test by participating in various CTFs, challenges and Pwnbox challenges, I learned many things along the way. Each competition, a valuable lesson, refined my skills and deepened my understanding.
    <br> <br>
    While interested in collaborative security exercises like purple teaming, my ultimate passion lies in the intricacies of offensive security. While exploring the collaborative world of purple teaming, I'm simultaneously enriching my understanding of DevOps and its impact on security landscapes.
